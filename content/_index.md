# Welcome to the UK Web Archive

The UK Web Archive is dedicated to preserving the digital heritage of the United Kingdom. We collect, preserve, and provide access to UK websites, ensuring that this valuable cultural and historical resource remains available for researchers, historians, and the general public.

## Our Mission

We work to capture and archive the UK's web content before it disappears, creating a comprehensive historical record of the UK's digital presence. Our archive includes government websites, cultural institutions, businesses, organizations, and personal websites that tell the story of the UK online.

## Why Archive the Web?

The web is constantly changing. Websites are updated, redesigned, or taken down entirely. Without archiving, this information is lost forever. The UK Web Archive ensures that:

- Historical records are preserved
- Research materials remain accessible
- Cultural heritage is protected
- Government information is retained
- Educational resources are maintained

## Get Involved

You can help preserve the UK web by:

- Nominating important UK websites for archiving
- Supporting our preservation efforts
- Using our archive for research and education
- Spreading awareness about digital preservation
